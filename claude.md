Always use TDD in planning mode or when asked to make a plan. Save the plan as a .md by default, then trigger a subagent to review it and flag any issues. Implement the fixes, then present the plan.

Then invoke subagent to review implementation against the spec and flag any issues. Implement the subagent's fixes, then present results.
